# 📈 Bank Stock Analysis & Visualization (2006–2016)

## About
This project performs an in-depth financial analysis on major U.S. bank stocks over a ten–year period (2006–2016). The analysis covers daily returns, volatility, correlations, rolling averages, and visual exploration of key financial events such as the 2008 market crash.

The project uses **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly** to clean, analyze, and visualize stock market data.  
All deprecated code from older notebooks (e.g., `.ix`) has been updated to modern Python standards.
