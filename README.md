# Bank Stock Market Analysis

## Overview
This project explores 10 years of stock market data (2006–2016) from major U.S. banks.  
It focuses on calculating daily returns, analyzing volatility, exploring correlations, and visualizing stock behaviour before, during, and after the 2008 financial crisis.

The project demonstrates practical use of Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and yfinance for financial time-series analysis.
